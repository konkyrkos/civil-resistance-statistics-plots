# Exploring Why Civil Resistance Works

Replicate some of the findings of a well-received book, Why Civil Resistance Works by Erical Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan. The two authors examined whether nonviolent campaigns are more effective than violent campaigns. They found that yes; from a data set containing details of campaigns from 1900 onwards, they found that in general peaceful campaigns are more effective in achieving their aims than violent ones.

To answer the following questions we will use the data that the authors helpfully provide at https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Data-and-Replication-Files-3.zip. The data is in Stata format, which pandas can read without a problem.

## Frequency of Nonviolent and Violent Campaign End Years

Creating a plot showing the frequency of nonviolent and violent campaigns; the frequency is counted based on their end years, at decades. The violent and nonviolent campaign counts are stacked on each other.

## Number of Nonviolent Campaigns and Percentage of Success

Creating a plot showing, for each decade from 1940 onwards, the number of nonviolent campaigns and the percentage of success.

## Success Rate by Decade

Creating a plot showing the success rate for violent and nonviolent campaigns by decade. 

## Twenty-Five Largest Resistance Campaigns, 1900-2006

Creating a table with the twenty-five largest resistance campaigns, for all years, based on their number of members at highest point (peak membership).

## The Effect of Participation on the Probability of Campaign Success

Examining the effect of participation on the probability of campaign success. 

## The Level of Participation Tipping Point

From the results obtained, we find the percentage of the population that is the tipping point for success in a campaign.

## Nonviolent Resistance, Target Regime Type, Geographical Location

Examining whether nonviolent resistance remains significant even if we control for the regime type and also whether nonviolent resistance remains significant even if we control for geographical location of the compaign.
